## Dependencies

ROS, obviously. You may have heard of the pain of trying to build ROS on a Raspberry Pi. Ubiquity Robotics has your back there with their [Ubuntu Pi + ROS images](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html), batteries already included. Note that this setup has only been tested on ROS Kinetic and Melodic.

ROS Donkey also depends on Ubiquity Robotics' `raspicam_node` for camera input. If you use their image above, it may already be installed. However, just in case, instructions to install or build it can be found at this [Github repository](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/raspicam_node)

## Install

```
mkdir -p ~/donkey_ws/src
cd ~/donkey_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:liamondrop/ros-donkey.git
cd ~/donkey_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Usage

### Vehicle Configuration

In the `ros_donkey` directory, there is a file called `config.yaml`. This contains the parameters for the steering and throttle servos, the raspicam, and mapping the joystick controls. You may need to change these for your particular setup.

### Joystick Setup

Currently, this project is only designed to work with a Linux compatible joystick, such as the Logitech F710. See [this page](http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick) for more info.

### Raspicam Setup

The `raspicam_node` repository mentioned above in dependencies will help you get the camera up and running. Note that you can use `rqt_image_view` to view the video stream and `rqt_reconfigure` to help fine tune the camera settings (things like ISO, white balance, video stabilization, etc.).

### Servo Setup

The `donkey_actuator` node listens to two topics:

 - `/donkey/servo_absolute`: this topic accepts a `donkey_actuator/Servo` message. The main purpose of this topic is to send pwm signals to help you fine tune the configuration of your servos. The following messages are an example of using this topic to find the pulse value corresponding to the steering servo's center, i.e. 333:
    ```
    rostopic pub /donkey/servo_absolute donkey_actuator/Servo "{name: steering, value: 300}"
    rostopic pub /donkey/servo_absolute donkey_actuator/Servo "{name: steering, value: 350}"
    rostopic pub /donkey/servo_absolute donkey_actuator/Servo "{name: steering, value: 330}"
    rostopic pub /donkey/servo_absolute donkey_actuator/Servo "{name: steering, value: 335}"
    rostopic pub /donkey/servo_absolute donkey_actuator/Servo "{name: steering, value: 333}"
    ```
 - `/donkey/drive`: this topic is intended for control and accepts a standard `geometry_msgs/Twist` message, using the `linear.x` value for the throttle and the `angular.z` value for the steering. Note that these values should be between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive. The following is an example of a command to drive straight forward at 75% throttle:
    ```
    rostopic pub /donkey/drive geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.75}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"
    ```

### Launching the Vehicle

Issue the following command to start up the car:

```
roslaunch ros_donkey vehicle.launch
```

This will bring up the servo actuator, joystick controller, and raspicam nodes.
